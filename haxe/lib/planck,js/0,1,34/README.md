# Planck.js<sup>&alpha;</sup>

Planck.js is JavaScript rewrite of Box2D physics engine for cross-platform HTML5 game development. **[Check out demos!](http://piqnt.com/planck.js/)**

[![Car](./doc/img/screenshot.png "Play")](http://piqnt.com/planck.js/Car)

## Motivations

Key motivations for the development of this project are:
- Taking advantage of Box2D's efforts and achievements
- Developing readable and maintainable JavaScript code
- Optimizing the library for web and mobile platforms
- Providing a JavaScript-friendly API

## Try it

To try Planck.js, simply add `planck-with-testbed.js` script to your HTML code and call `planck.testbed(callback)` with your code in callback. For example:

```html
<html><body>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/planck/0.1/planck-with-testbed.js"></script>
  <script>
    planck.testbed(function(testbed) {
      var world = planck.World();
      // rest of your code
      return world; // make sure you return the world
    });
  </script>
</body></html>
```

Check out [Car example on JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/nujuxik/edit?html,output) to try it in practice.
Also see [`example`](./example/) directory for more testbed usage examples.

## Usage

Planck.js does not use any renderer by default. To use or integrate it with a rendering library all you need to do 
is call `world.step(timeStep)` in each frame, and then iterate over world entities to draw or update them.
You may also want to listen to world events to remove objects which are removed from the world. For example:

```html
<script src="./path/to/planck.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var world = planck.World();

  window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {
    // in each frame call world.step(timeStep) with fixed timeStep
    world.step(1 / 60);
    // iterate over bodies and fixtures
    for (var body = world.getBodyList(); body; body = body.getNext()) {
      for (var fixture = body.getFixtureList(); fixture; fixture = fixture.getNext()) {
        // draw or update fixture
      }
    }
  });

   world.on('remove-fixture', function(fixture) {
    // remove fixture from ui
  });
</script>
```

## API

Planck.js public API closely follows Box2D API (see [Resources](#Resources)), with the following differences:

- `b2` prefix is dropped from class names, for example `b2World` is now available as `planck.World`.
- Method names are converted from UpperCamelCase to lowerCamelCase.
- Definition classes/objects (BodyDef, FixtureDef, etc.) are replaced by inline JavaScript objects (`{}`).
- Shapes are made immutable and are not cloned when used to create fixtures.
- `World#on(eventName, listenerFn)` and `World#off(eventName, listenerFn)` are added to add and remove event listeners. Currently supported events are:
    - `'begin-contact'`
    - `'end-contact'`
    - `'pre-solve'`
    - `'post-solve'`
    - `'joint-removed'`
    - `'fixture-removed'`
    - `'body-removed'`

## Testbed

Another way to use testbed and try included examples (in [`example`](./example/) directory) is running testbed with live build locally:

1. Install `git` and `npm`

1. Clone or download this repository

1. Install npm and bower dependencies:

        npm install

1. Run testbed and open it in your web browser (see command-line output for URL to open):

        npm run testbed


## Architecture

Planck.js includes Box2D algorithms without modification and its internal architecture and public API are very similar to Box2D.
However some [changes](./CHANGES.md) and refactoring are made during rewrite to address differences between C++ and JavaScript.


## Credits

[Box2D](http://box2d.org/) is a popular C++ 2D rigid-body physics engine created by [Erin Catto](https://twitter.com/erin_catto). Box2D is used in several popular games, such as Angry Birds, Limbo and Crayon Physics, as well as game development tools and libraries such as Apple's SpriteKit.
